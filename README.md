# Galactic Guardians - Persistent MMO Role Playing Game
## Why Am I Building This?
This is a starter project which I would like to build and expand upon as I continue to learn new technologies. The project will be slow at first, but speed up as I learn more.

I want to build something other people can enjoy, so thought this was the best way forward. The project will include:
- HTML / CSS / JS for the frontend
- I'm not sure what for the backend just yet!
- mySQL for databases

I have only been coding for around a month with around 30 hours of development so far. I have only just learned about Github and still mastering the basics.

>*Note:* As I learn more, this project will most likely change a lot and may end up being re-written. However, I will keep an update of progress.

## Project Overview
Galactic Guardians is a free-to-play text-based, idle, persistent MMO that thrusts players into a rich and expansive universe set in the distant future among the stars. As a new adventurer on a planet undergoing colonisation, players navigate through a world where innovation meets the cosmos. Unlike traditional medieval fantasy settings, Galactic Guardians introduces a futuristic realm filled with advanced weaponry, high-tech medical solutions, and unique challenges.

## Game Features
>*Note:* This is not an exhaustive list and will most likely change as I progress
I want the game to be fun to play, with features that provide a return for players (which is where the idle elements come into play).

### Main Gameplay Loop
The user will start as a new adventurer on a world which is starting to be colonised. This means that there are buildings which need to be created, new gear to be made / found and aliens around every corner.

This means that the player will need to help build things which will access higher level equipment and resources, they will need to level up through combat and will eventually have individual skills like crafting and gathering (TBD).

A player will fight monsters and gather resources, use those resources to build buildings and equipment. Then repeat as they gain levels, credits and better weapons and armour.

### Fighting Monsters
Players will fight a range of monsters in different areas which are unlocked by levelling up. The fighting mechanics will be tick based and will either hit or miss. If the player hits, then the damage will be calculated. The same is true for enemies.

When an enemy has been killed, they will drop experience, credits and various resources with a variety of rarity.

### Gathering Resources
This section of the game still needs to be thought out to help uniqueness. However, for now - the main method of resource gathering will be through combat.

### Construction
As the world is being colonised, we need to build out the cities which will be inhabited. Utilising different resources, players will be able to come together and build the buildings that will help them move forward in this unknown world.

## Accessing The Game
For now, whilst in initial development, the game will not be playable. However, I will provide weekly updates on the project on Twitter, which will include screenshots. Once I feel the game is accessible, then I will share how to take part!
